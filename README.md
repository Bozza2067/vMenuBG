# vMenu
vMenu is a server-side menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support. This custom version has been modified for my FiveM server.


\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

## MenuAPI
Starting from vMenu v2.1.0, vMenu will be using [MenuAPI (MAPI)](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI), a custom menu API designed specifically for vMenu by me.

vMenu v2.0.0 and earlier was [using a modified version of NativeUI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/NativeUI), originally by [Guad](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI), but converted to FiveM by the CitizenFX Collectives and myself (updated/refactored).
